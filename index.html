Freedom of Identity<br><span class="rightsdesc">Consistent Progressives promote and defend the right to freedom of identity- this is the right of all beings to a <a style="color:#FF00FF !important" href="#TransIDdef">TransID</a>, to openly express and affirm it in any way one desires, and to have it respected as their intrinsic selves. Every individual has the right to identify in any way, shape, or form they want, as well as to modify themselves in any way they want to affirm their identity. No individual should ever have any restrictions whatsoever placed upon them because of an identity characteristic (i.e., race, gender identity, sexuality, mentality, age, etc), nor be inhibited in any way, shape, or form from expressing their identity, nor have any identity characteristics assigned to them at birth as all beings from the moment they exist have the right to complete and total unilateral control over their own identity, whether they use it to identify in the way they feel is natural for their being, or to change it into something they feel better suits them.<br><span class="subte">(This necessitates the abolition of any &amp; all restrictions to any being delineated by an identity characteristic, thus bringing about LGBTQIA+ liberation, BIPOC liberation, radqueer liberation, gender abolition, liberation of <a style="color:#FF00FF !important" href="#TransIDdef">TransIDs</a>, the freedom to as well as destigmatization of public nudity, the abolition of corporations, &amp; the abolition of <em>all</em> <a style="color:#FF00FF !important" href="#govtdef">states/governments</a>, among many other concepts.)</span></span></div><br><br><div class="rights">2. Bodily Autonomy<br><span class="rightsdesc">From the right to freedom of identity can be derived a fundamental right to bodily autonomy, which is the right to complete and total unilateral control over what is to go into one's own body and how one's own body is to be modified in any way, shape, or form, if at all. Central to this right is the freedom to create and/or join <a style="color:#FF00FF !important" href="#VSRdef">VSRs (Voluntary Social Relations)</a> with other beings, <a style="color:#FF00FF !important" href="#VSRdef">VSRs</a> being the sole basis permitted for social relations as a whole and allowing beings within them to freely interact with each other, so long as none assert themselves as an authority or ruler over anyone else in the relation and all remain in said relation only as long as they find it to suit their desires. This right through the <a style="color:#FF00FF !important" href="#VSRdef">VSR</a> model defends concepts such as free abortions, free alcohol/drug usage, prosthetic modifications, etc, so long as all are undergone exclusively by those desiring it done to themselves; no individual should ever be forcefully inhibited from taking any action upon their own body, nor should any action be taken upon their own body by another that all involved have not explicitly agreed to through <a style="color:#FF00FF !important" href="#VSRdef">VSRs</a>.<br><span class="subte">(This necessitates youth liberation, neurodivergent liberation, animal liberation, and the abolition of the <a style="color:#FF00FF !important" href="#familydef">family institution</a>, among many other concepts.)</span></span></div><br><br><div class="rights">3. Free Love<br><span class="rightsdesc">All beings have a right to free love; this is the logical extension of the rights to freedom of identity and bodily autonomy, as all individuals have the right to freely and openly express their romantic and sexual orientation, and engage in any romantic or sexual activity with any other beings they want, so long as it is done through the <a style="color:#FF00FF !important" href="#VSRdef">VSR</a> model; no individual should ever be inhibited from pursuing a romantic or sexual relation with any beings they wish to through <a style="color:#FF00FF !important" href="#VSRdef">VSRs</a>, nor be stigmatized, shunned, or otherwise persecuted in any way, shape, or form for their choices in doing so, so long as all involved are <a style="color:#FF00FF !important" href="#progressivismdef">progressive</a> and have opted-in to the relation through <a style="color:#FF00FF !important" href="#VSRdef">VSRs</a>.<br><span class="subte">(This necessitates the liberation, destigmatization, and freedom of polyamory, sex work, GRSM liberation, sex positivity, exhibitionism, masturbation, consanguinamory/incest, MAPs/YAPs, AAMs/AAYs, zoosexuality, necrophilia, and all <a style="color:#FF00FF !important" href="#paradef">paraphilias</a>, among many other concepts, through the <a style="color:#FF00FF !important" href="#VSRdef">VSR</a> model.)</span></span></div></p></div></div><br>

To replace state functions, bottom-up methods of organization are put in place as opposed to the statist top-down/centralized ones, in essence creating a &quot;rule without rulers&quot;, &quot;order without hierarchy&quot;, &quot;governance without government&quot;, &amp; &quot;organization without centralization&quot;. Rather than there being a central control over defense, government of any kind ceases to exist at all, allowing defense to be left to the sole control of progressives in VSRs, who now, rather than being locked to only one method of force/violence (the state), now have access to a vast variety of different means of defense/violence (i.e., localized militias, mutual defense, community VSRs, etc), which they can spontaneously swap between at any moment, ensuring all possible forces to eradicate conservatism are available.<br><span class="lmmmmm">Synonymous with &quot;statelessness&quot;, &quot;horizontalism&quot;, &amp; &quot;anarchism&quot;.</span></p><br><li id="TransIDdef" class="drpoint">Transidentity</li><p class="drpcont">Any identity a being may have that differs from one assigned at birth to them by society. The most common among them is transgender, but TransIDs expand to include any aspect of ones identity that deviates from the one society has applied to them. TransIDs include, but are not limited to: transgender, transage, trace, transabled, transbody, transpecies.<br><span class="lmmmmm">More can be learned about TransIDs <a id="lern" href="https://transid.org/books/transid">here</a>.</span></p><br><li id="paradef" class="drpoint">Paraphilia</li><p class="drpcont">Any sexuality/attraction/'philia' bearing the unique empirical status of extensive (relative to most other sexualities) persecution &amp; stigmatization within conservative society; para sexualities are identifiable by their artificial (gained by conservatives) non-normative/atypical reception within society. Para sexualities include, but are not limited to: intra/chronophilias (M/YAPs &amp; AAM/Ys), zoophilia, necrophilia, consanguinamory/incest, objectophilia/objectum.<br><span class="lmmmmm">More can be learned about different paraphilias <a id="lern" href="https://transid.org/books/paraphilias-and-kinks">here</a>.</span></p><br><li id="VSRdef" class="drpoint">VSR</li><p class="drpcont">A progressive social relation structure that any non-conservative who is not a BWUI can join, requiring that every single being involved has chosen to opt-in to it solely of their own volitional pleasure desire, remains there only as long as they find the relation satisfies their desire, &amp; is free to exit at any point without any restrictions or barriers to doing so. Short for &quot;Voluntary Social Relation&quot;, VSRs would be the universal all-encapsulating model for relations in progressivism, taking the place of all social interactions as a whole but <em>especially</em> the coercive ones existing under conservatism, including but not limited to: the family institution, marriage, education, production.</p><br><li id="bwuidef" class="drpoint">BWUI</li><p class="drpcont">Any individual entirely incapable of communcation* of any kind (both speech and movement), placing them in a position where they are essentially &quot;Beings With Unobservable Intent&quot; (as they can't speak in any way, nor can they move, thus leaving them with no means of making other beings aware of their desires). Other than conservatives, BWUIs are the only beings incapable of joining VSRs, though this is not because of some ageist or ableist &quot;subhuman&quot; factor like what is present in conservatism; quite the contrary actually, as BWUIs are viewed &amp; treated equally to everyone else. There's nothing <em>external</em> stopping them from joining VSRs at all; the only reason they're incapable of joining is because due to not being able to communicate, it would be impossible to know whether a BWUI is opting-in to join a VSR or not (having any way of knowing this would mean they can communicate, and thus would no longer be considered a BWUI), &amp; as such it would be assumed that they aren't until they indicate otherwise, thus negating the BWUI condition. It is possible for any being to transition in and out of being a BWUI at any point, though remaining a BWUI is a very short-lived and temporary experience.<br><span class="lmmmmm">*(&quot;Communication&quot; here is used in a very broad sense, defined as anything an individual can do to make another individual aware of something the first individual would like to express. Communication is not limited to speech, though speech is the most common form of communication, &amp; communication can also take the form of things such as writing, hand signals, body language, or braille. It is for this reason that movement is relevant, as being able to move can be fell-back on if speech is not available to a given being as a form of communication.

" alt="No queers left behind."><br><br>The Consistent Progressive platform is that no being should ever be persecuted for their identity, &amp; all should be able to live, have total bodily autonomy, and identify in any way, shape or form that they want. All social relations should turn into VSRs and follow the VSR structure model, where all who are involved with a relation have chosen to opt-in to it, stay in the relation only as long as it makes them happy, &amp; are free to exit at any point unchallenged.<br><br>Central to the VSR model is advocacy of the abolition of the family institution, as it perpetuates many of the worst and most widespread forms of conservatism, and through a eugenicist lense at that. From this, Consistent Progressives promote polyamory, TransIDs, consanguinamory/incest, free love, the abolition of any and all age limits/restrictions (allowing for free MAP/YAP &amp; AAM/AAY VSR relations), &amp; the abolition of ableism.<br><br>Consistent Progressives also advocate the abolition of compulsory schooling, with the same VSR model coming in to replace this, where attendance is both optional and solely decided by those attending,  placing those choosing to attend of their own volition at the forefront of their curriculum, where they control the pace, content, length, &amp; structure of their education through a bottom-up model as opposed to the top-down one of the state, assuming they want social education at all as they would have the freedom not to and to self-educate as well.<br><br>We also advocate the abolition of all nations, borders, police, central militaries, courts, and governments/states, in favor of a decentralized progressivism model built through VSRs, where individuals can freely join VSRs that would be formed for the purpose of defending against conservatism, and as such these defense VSRs would grow into bottom-up interconnected local militias, community organizations, and mutual defense pacts focused entirely towards anti-conservatism with no central point of command for conservatives to strike at due to the decentralized model, allowing for rapid adjustment to any potential lingering conservatives or conservative attacks, with the decentralization also allowing for the militias to quickly work together and outnumber any who flip and turn conservative.<br><br>We advocate the abolition of purity culture &amp; all conservative social norms assigned to beings over traits such as race, ethnicity, gender identity, age, and mentality, in favor of a society where individuals start &amp; stay as free beings not tethered to any preimposed norms or standards upon their identity.<br><br>As progressives, we are open to <em>almost</em> any form of praxis to spread consistent progressivism, but we do have very specific exceptions of praxis that we will <b>not</b> tolerate:<br><li class="drpoint">Pacifism</li><p class="drpcont">Pacifism, defined as a praxis rejecting the use of violence, is the death of any and all ideologies that it touches. This is because violence is <em>required</em>, both by conservatism &amp; progressivism, to enforce anything that they want to do, albeit for drastically different purposes since conservatives want genocide and progressives want to defend from genocide. If progressives are not permitted to use violence, liberation cannot be secured &amp; the conservatives, who have no problem whatsoever with violence, will win out. For this reason, we reject pacifism as a valid praxis, even if pacifism itself technically does not contradict progressivism.</p><br><li class="drpoint">Left-Unity/Transitory Statism</li><p class="drpcont">As progressives, we reject any and all forms of conservatism. This includes the state. For this plain and simple direct reason, we refuse to ally ourselves with anyone who believes &quot;transitory statism&quot; is a valid praxis; progressives want nothing whatsoever to do with tankies. If someone does not seek the complete &amp; total abolition of <b>all</b> forms of conservatism <em>including the state</em>, they do not share our goals and are a conservative, thus they are an enemy. We entirely reject the foolish idea that a form of conservatism can be used to abolish conservatism; we seek the abolition of conservatism through <em>decentralization/statelessness</em> strictly, as it is the only structure consistent &amp; compatible with the goal.</p><br><li class="drpoint">Compromise</li><p class="drpcont">We refuse on all grounds to compromise on any of our principles; we seek the abolition of <em>all</em> forms of conservatism &amp; the liberation of <em>all</em> identities (yes, this includes MAPs/YAPs/AAMs/AAYs, Zoos, &amp; Necros, with a strict pro-contact stance on all three). We seek the complete and total destruction of the family structure as it is a <b>slavery</b> institution, &amp; seek to replace it with a VSR model. We promote more forms of &quot;degeneracy&quot; &amp; &quot;wokeness&quot; than even Hitler 2.0 &amp; his MAGA nazis have nightmares about. We promote total LGBTQIA+, radqueer, &amp; youth liberation (no age limits on <em>anything</em>), unrestricted public nudity, free pornography, &amp; a hedonistic pleasure society without age boundaries. We are anti-gun regulation of any kind, &amp; seek for all progressives to freely acquire any firearms they desire so that they can defend themselves against conservatism &amp; aid progressive militias. We seek the complete and total abolition of all <em>forms</em> of nationalism, borders, and governments, &amp; <em>most importantly of all</em>, we seek to wipe all forms of bigotry, prejudice, eugenicism (this includes so-called race &quot;science&quot;, gender binary &quot;science&quot;/gender &quot;biology&quot;, brain development &quot;science&quot;, TERFs, SWERFs, truscums, sysmeds, &amp; &quot;human nature&quot; &quot;science&quot;), &amp; discrimination (broadly classed &quot;conservatism&quot;) off the face of the Earth, along with every single conservative standing in the way of liberation.<br><br>Any of this sound too &quot;radical&quot; for you? Feel free to go to some conservative platform then, because we vehemently <b>refuse</b> to compromise on <em>any</em> of it.</p><br><br><p class="pltfrm">Overall, we seek the complete and total abolition of all forms of conservatism, which is what this entire platform can be shortened to. Consistent Progressivism welcomes all who aren't conservative.<br>Liberation is non-negotiable.</p></p></details><br><details class="openablebox"><summary class="displtex" title="Click to open the Consistent Progressivism theory PDFs.">Consistent Progressivism Theory Documents</summary><li class="drpoint"><a class="theory" href="The%20Noveltist%20Analysis%20of%20the%20state.pdf">The state as a form of conservatism</a><br><span class="lmmmmm">(&quot;The Noveltist Analysis of the state&quot;)</span></li><br><li class="drpoint"><a class="theory" href="Centrism%20as%20an%20impossibility.pdf">Centrism as impossible (you are either conservative or progressive; there is no in-between and there is no neither)</a><br><span class="lmmmmm">(&quot;Centrism as an impossibility&quot;)</span></li><br><li class="drpoint"><a class="theory" href="Abolish%20Families.pdf">The family institution as a form of conservatism due to being slavery</a><br><span class="lmmmmm">(&quot;Abolish Families&quot;)</span></li><br><li class="drpoint"><a class="theory" href="The%20Benefits%20of%20Decentralization.pdf">Progressive defense structures</a><br><span class="lmmmmm">(&quot;The Benefits of Decentralization&quot;)</span></li><br><li class="drpoint"><a class="theory" href="The%20Spectrum%20of%20Conservatism.pdf">Identifying different types of conservatism</a><br><span class="lmmmmm">(&quot;The Spectrum of Conservatism&quot;)</span></li><br><li class="drpoint"><a class="theory" href="Abolish%20Families%20(An%20Appendix).pdf">An elaboration on family abolitionism and the family institution's conservative branches</a><br><span class="lmmmmm">(&quot;Abolish Families (An Appendix)&quot;)</span></li><br><li class="drpoint"><a class="theory" href="Para-Progressivism.pdf">The Consistent Progressive platform for para-unity</a><br><span class="lmmmmm">(&quot;Para-Progressivism&quot;)</span></li><br><li class="drpoint"><a class="theory" href="An%20Extension%20to%20Liberation.pdf">An expansion on the para-unity platform</a><br><span class="lmmmmm">(&quot;An Extension to Liberation&quot;)</span></li><br></details><br><details class="openablebox"><summary class="displtex" title="Click to see frequently asked questions about Consistent Progressivism.">A Progressive FAQ</summary><li class="drpoint">Q: &quot;Why is it called 'consistent' progressivism? Is there a such thing as 'inconsistent progressivism'?&quot;</li><p class="drpcont">A: Because there are a large number of conservatives who have tried to explicitly call themselves &quot;progressives&quot; despite their ideology directly contradicting progressivism by allowing conservatism in order to mask that they are conservatives. Therefore, the added modifier term of &quot;consistent&quot; is necessary to differentiate from the other so-called &quot;progressives&quot; who are not actually progressive in the slightest. And no, there is not any such thing as &quot;inconsistent progressivism&quot; because progressivism is a static stance, being the total negation of all forms of conservatism; it is not possible to have an inconsistent version of this because it only has one singular version to begin with. At the instant that the &quot;progressivism&quot; of anyone allows conservatism, it is no longer progressivism. Similar to how a light switch can only ever be on or off at once, but would not be considered &quot;off&quot; if it was merely dim or flickering, as off is its own seperate static condition within the binary of &quot;off&quot; and &quot;on&quot;.<br><span class="lmmmmm">(Please read the &quot;<a class="lern" href="The%20Spectrum%20of%20Conservatism.pdf">The Spectrum of Conservatism</a>&quot; article for more theory on this topic.)</span></p><br><li class="drpoint">Q: &quot;The Consistent Progressive definitions don't look familiar to me; doesn't 'conservatism' have something to do with traditional values and/or the status quo?&quot;</li><p class="drpcont">A: No it does not, as no objectivity can be found in the use of &quot;status quo&quot; or &quot;traditional values&quot; as part of the definition. The only semblance of truth to them being associated with conservatism at all is that they are both <em>empirically</em> conservative. But it is that exact reason- that they are only <em><b>empirically</b></em> conservative, why they can't be part of the definition. Traditions are empirically conservative because it just so happens to be that all of history has been filled with far more examples of conservatism in practice than progressivism; consistent conservative societies have existed numerous times in many places, compared to very few consistent progressive ones, if any at all. This same reasoning applies to the status quo; the status quo is conservative, but only <em>as of right now</em>. The thing making these not able to be included in the definition is the fact that it is entirely possible for both traditions and the status quo to switch to progressivism; if a progressive society were to be established, the status quo there would change from conservatism to progressivism, and eventually as it continues to exist over time, progressivism would eventually become a tradition there. Traditions and the status quo are entirely subjective based on the time and place- they are empirical statements rather than intrinsic connections, which is the reason they cannot have anything to do with the definition of &quot;conservatism&quot;. Not only are they merely empirical statements however, but they're also commonly used by conservatives to try to create a smokescreen around conservatism in order to trick unsuspecting &quot;centrists&quot; into thinking that these empirical statements are somehow the definition, so that when they explain it to an unsuspecting apolitical, the apolitical is tricked into falling under the smokescreen and viewing conservatism as &quot;not that bad if it just means 'traditions'&quot;, entirely unaware that the specific &quot;traditions&quot; conservatives support are the conservative ones: the genocidal, pro-slavery, discriminatory ones. &quot;Traditional values&quot; and the &quot;status quo&quot; are smokescreens, and Consistent Progressivism seeks to break the smokescreen.<br><span class="lmmmmm">(Please read the &quot;<a class="lern" href="Centrism%20as%20an%20impossibility.pdf">Centrism as an impossibility</a>&quot; article for more theory on this topic.)</span></p><br><li class="drpoint">Q: &quot;Would Consistent Progressives be against those with 'conservative lifestyles'?&quot;</li><p class="drpcont">A: Consistent Progressives are vehemently against <em>all</em> conservatives and forms of conservatism, period. However, this is a question that makes no sense from the start, because conservatism is not a &quot;lifestyle&quot;; it is not an identity nor a personal stance of any kind. Conservatism is strictly an interpersonal stance on the identities of others, in that their identities are viewed as &quot;subhuman&quot;; there is no such thing as a &quot;conservative lifestyle&quot; because conservatism exists through the <b><em>interpersonal</em></b>, not the personal.<br><span class="lmmmmm">(Please read the &quot;<a class="lern" href="The%20Spectrum%20of%20Conservatism.pdf">The Spectrum of Conservatism</a>&quot; article for more theory on this topic.)</span></p><br><li class="drpoint">Q: &quot;I saw MAPs listed in the dotted-list thing; does Consistent Progressivism support pedophilia?&quot;</li><p class="drpcont">A: Yes, along with incest, zoophilia, necrophilia, and all of the other paraphilias. What's important to emphasize is that all of these should be differentiated from rape (sexual relations with a living being who did not communicate opting-in to such relation), which Consistent Progressives <em>do not</em> support, as it is a form of conservatism.

However, there is an official negative stance, being that we obviously do not support any economic systems that allow for or require conservatism, which would include currently existing &quot;capitalism&quot;/corporatism, and all forms of non-stateless &quot;socialism&quot;/&quot;communism&quot; (the central planning/DOTP kind). We do not support central planning, reformism, state regulations/intervention, corporations, landlordism dynamics, absentee/&quot;private&quot; (according to some definitions) property, hierarchies, or the state as a whole, as all of these are viewed as forms of conservatism.<br><span class="lmmmmm">(Please read the &quot;<a class="lern" href="The%20Benefits%20of%20Decentralization.pdf">The Benefits of Decentralization</a>&quot; article for more theory on this topic.)</span></p><br><li class="drpoint">Q: &quot;What is your contact stance?&quot;</li><p class="drpcont">A: Progressives are pro-contact for all sexualities via the VSR model; no ifs, ands, or buts about it.
